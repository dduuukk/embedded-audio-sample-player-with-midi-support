## Lessons Learned

One for entire project.
Discuss the lessons learned from the design and implementation. Would we make different decisions after we have completed the project?


Things fail silently and are hard to debug

WAV file header formats can very greatly

Learned how to work around hardware decisions that were not under our control

Learned about the limitations of AXI and AHB bus interconnects and how they impact making DMA based software.

Adding MIDI made the project more fun for users, good call to go to the stretch goal.

Learned that it is feasible to and is worth it to re-implement daisy library code in a way that is much more useful to specific use cases.


Having completed the project, there is not a different path that we would take. The undertaking of this project would be easier now that we know all of the issues we faced, but design decision wise there wasn't something that really hurt the project.
