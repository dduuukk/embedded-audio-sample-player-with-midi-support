# BOOMBA
## Project proposal: embedded audio player on freeRTOS-based system

## Team members and responsibilities 
- Christian Bender
- Katherine Cloutier
- Christian Cole
- Noah Mitchell 



## Work involved: 
Bootstrap a FreeRTOS based system on an STM32 dev board with an audio
codec, SD card reader, and headphone amplifier. Port WAV parser/player, and write drivers for
codec (I2S) and headphone driver
## End goal: parse a .WAV file off of the SD card on the system and play it over the headphone out
## Stretch goal: UI with buttons and the OLED screen!


## Overall Description

## System diagram
(with individual components and their interfaces. This visualization should take the initial feedback into account and be more detailed than the Project Idea submission.)
